**Project Name: Customer-Churn-Prediction SQL Project using Windows function in SQL**

ðŸš€ **Problem Statement**

- Customer churn (customers leaving a company) is a huge problem for subscription-based businesses.
The challenge is to analyze customer behavior, identify churn risk, and retain customers before they leave.

ðŸš€ **Solution**

- Using SQL Windows Functions, we performed advanced analytics such as:

  1. Ranking customers by churn probability

  2. Finding average tenure and charges across groups

  3. Calculating running totals & moving averages for churn trends
  
  4. Identifying top churn reasons using ranking functions

   
ðŸš€ **concepts used in this project**.

    1.	Define windows functions in sql
    2.	Types of clauses
    3.	Aggregate windows functions
    4.	Ranking windows functions
    5.	Miscellaneous windows functions

ðŸš€ **Goal**: 

- To predict and analyze churn behavior using SQL.
- To gain insights that help in customer retention strategies.
- To showcase real-time SQL expertise for Data Scientist/Analyst interviews.

ðŸš€ **Tech stack**: 

- Database: MySQL
- Tools: SQL Workbench / Jupyter Notebook with SQL connector
- Dataset: Customer Churn dataset

ðŸš€ **Tech Used**

- Windows Functions in SQL (Aggregate, Ranking, Miscellaneous)
- Database Normalization
- Advanced Queries with Joins & Subqueries
- Churn prediction insights
  
ðŸš€ **Key skills shown**: 

- SQL Windows Functions (OVER, PARTITION BY, ORDER BY)
- Churn trend analysis with aggregate functions
- Ranking churned customers
- Writing real-world SQL reports

ðŸš€ **What I did in this project**?

- Created normalized tables (Customers, Contracts, Services, Payments)
- Applied Windows Functions to churn dataset
- Solved real-time business problems like:
- Who are the top churn customers by charges?
- Whatâ€™s the average monthly charges for churned vs active customers?
- Which tenure range has the highest churn?
- Generated insights dashboards with SQL queries

ðŸš€ **What I learnt**?

- Mastered Windows Functions in SQL
- Learnt Aggregate, Ranking, Miscellaneous window functions
- Understood real-world churn analytics use cases
- Improved SQL problem-solving for Data Science

ðŸš€ **What is impact**?

- Helped business reduce churn by identifying high-risk customers early
- Provided data-driven retention strategies
- Made the project resume-ready & job-attractive
